Only has 3 shells but they shoot farther than normal, makes it easier to snipe parts\nWide: highest shell damage/cost, shells are really easy to land but hard to hit specific parts with their large AOE. Much higher Charged Shell damage, as in like 50\% more, it is strong. 2 shells so FB sucks\nSimply, Normal = combo a lot, FB and Heat Blade. Long = sniping parts, spam charged WF. Wide = shell like a mofo and charged shell when you can.```"
